# Child_Predictor_Model

Offspringâ€™s appearances are inherited from their parents and the connections between them like identification and establishment of familial relationships have been studied.GANs are capable of generating high-quality representations of child faces by handling child face prediction as an image-to-image translation task.

We present Offspring Predictor, a GAN-based method designed specifically for realistic child face prediction. Generated faces must be diverse and as similar to real children as possible when predicting child faces according to the looks of their parents.
